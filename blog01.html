    <div class="intro">
      A common misconception exists among people that front-end developers and
      UI developers are doing the same jobs with different titles. The
      above-mentioned statement holds no validity as the two perform completely
      different tasks and very different professions

      <h1>What does the UI Developer do?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        The UI Developers mainly works with design softwares such as Adobe
        PhotoShop, Illustrator and many similar softwares. They draw sketches
        and create graphic materials. Auxiliary tools that the UI developer use
        may include Microsoft Expression Design and Expression Blend. The
        designer must be well-versed with the UI guidelines to work on specific
        operating systems.

        <br />

        A crucial trait to become a UI developer is to think logically. UI
        developer is a thorough tech-savvy individual with a little knack for
        pure art. They use the mathematical and scientific approach to solve
        problems.
        <br />
        A good UI developer is a person with exceptional design skills and
        technical know-how and their work deals with the visual depiction of the
        user interfaces.
