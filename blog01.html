    <!-- intro -->
    <div class="intro">
      A common misconception exists among people that front-end developers and
      UI developers are doing the same jobs with different titles. The
      above-mentioned statement holds no validity as the two perform completely
      different tasks and very different professions

      <h1>What does the UI Developer do?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        The UI Developers mainly works with design softwares such as Adobe
        PhotoShop, Illustrator and many similar softwares. They draw sketches
        and create graphic materials. Auxiliary tools that the UI developer use
        may include Microsoft Expression Design and Expression Blend. The
        designer must be well-versed with the UI guidelines to work on specific
        operating systems.

        <br /><br />

        A crucial trait to become a UI developer is to think logically. UI
        developer is a thorough tech-savvy individual with a little knack for
        pure art. They use the mathematical and scientific approach to solve
        problems.
        <br />
        A good UI developer is a person with exceptional design skills and
        technical know-how and their work deals with the visual depiction of the
        user interfaces.

      <h1>What about the front end developers?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Front-end development is the type of interface development from the
        clientâ€™s side. Front-end developers are responsible to keep the
        interface running and operating seamlessly, in comparison to the visual
        depiction by the UI Developer. The Front-end developer needs to be
        well-equipped with a lot more programming languages and skills than a UI
        developer. They are well-versed with the HTTP protocols, how the servers
        and browsers work, etc. Biggest challenge associated with the front-end
        development is that the tools used to establish a websiteâ€™s front-end
        tends to change rapidly so the developer must be apt with the latest
        industry norms and knowledge.<br /><br />The 3 basic pillars on which
        front-end development is based today includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        As a front-end developer, he/she must be learned in the field of
        algorithms, coding patterns, object-oriented programming, functional
        approach, etc. Many times a front-end developer must find solutions
        regarding the UI problems on their stage of the development. That is why
        many front-end developers in a professional web design company know UI
        basics as well. The front-end developer is well educated with web
        architecture as well.
